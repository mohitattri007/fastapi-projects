# FastAPI Learning Projects

This repository documents my complete journey of learning FastAPI and modern backend development.  
It contains multiple small, practical projects that helped me understand:

- FastAPI routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Path & query parameters
- Pydantic models and validation
- Async/await and concurrency
- Dependency injection
- JWT authentication
- SQLModel / SQLAlchemy database integration
- Background tasks
- WebSockets & streaming
- API structuring and modular design

Each project is contained in its own folder with:
- Code examples  
- Requirements file  
- How-to-run instructions  
- Notes or learnings  

This repo will keep growing as I explore deeper backend concepts like microservices, caching, ORMs, async operations, and deployment on cloud environments.
